## Instructions

### Development Requirements

These instructions assume you have [node](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

To run the MapAttack web client locally, you will need the following node modules installed globally:

1. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): `npm install -g grunt-cli`
1. [Bower](http://bower.io/): `npm install -g bower`

### Installing locally

Run `npm install` to install server-side dependencies and `bower install` to install front-end dependencies.

`grunt install` has been added as a convenience task to install bower globally if it's missing then run `npm install` and `bower install`.

### Working locally

`grunt server` will start the server at `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Testing locally

* `grunt jshint` will lint javascript files.
