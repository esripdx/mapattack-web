## Instructions

### Development Requirements

These instructions assume you have [node](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

To run the MapAttack web client locally, you will need the following node modules installed globally:

1. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): `npm install -g grunt-cli`

### Installing locally

Run `npm install` to install server-side dependencies.

### Working locally

`grunt server` will clean the CSS directory, compile SASS, start the server at `http://localhost:3000/`, and restart the server when any watched files have changed.

### Testing locally

Use `grunt jshint` to lint javascript files.


### Building for production

Use `grunt build` to build all necessary files to the `public` directory. The site should be ready to be deployed to production after this step.
