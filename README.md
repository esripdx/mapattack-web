## Instructions

### Development Requirements

To run the MapAttack web client locally, you will need the following:

1. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
1. [Bower](http://bower.io/)

#### Mac OS X

If you haven't already done so, install your global dependencies. These instructions assume you have [node](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

1. `npm install -g grunt-cli`
1. `npm install -g bower`

Next, `cd` into the `mapattack-web` working directory and run `npm install` to make sure all node modules are present. You will also need to run `bower install` to install front-end dependencies.
